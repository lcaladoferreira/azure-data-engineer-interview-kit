# Data Warehousing — 30 In-depth Q&A

30 original interview questions with concise, production-oriented answers.


## 1. Design: star schema

**Question:** How should a data engineer approach **star schema** when the primary goal is to design a production warehouse workload?

**Answer:** Start by making the requirement measurable: throughput, latency, freshness, correctness, cost, RPO and RTO. For **star schema**, separate control-plane configuration from data-plane behavior, reproduce the issue with the smallest representative workload, and compare current telemetry with a known-good baseline. Explain the design choice, trade-off, and operational consequence. Prefer an idempotent change, test it outside production, deploy progressively, and keep a rollback path. Validate the result with service metrics plus a business-level data-quality check; a technically successful run that publishes incomplete or duplicated data is still a failure.
