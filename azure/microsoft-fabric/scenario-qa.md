# Microsoft Fabric Scenario Q&A — 75

75 original interview questions with concise, production-oriented answers.


## 1. Design: OneLake

**Question:** A production Microsoft Fabric workload using **OneLake** has rising latency, intermittent retries, and a strict recovery SLA. As the on-call data engineer, what would you design first?

**Answer:** Start by making the requirement measurable: throughput, latency, freshness, correctness, cost, RPO and RTO. For **OneLake**, separate control-plane configuration from data-plane behavior, reproduce the issue with the smallest representative workload, and compare current telemetry with a known-good baseline.

**Question:** A production Microsoft Fabric workload using **shortcuts** has rising latency, intermittent retries, and a strict recovery SLA. As the on-call data engineer, what would you optimize first?

**Answer:** Start by making the requirement measurable: throughput, latency, freshness, correctness, cost, RPO and RTO. For **shortcuts**, separate control-plane configuration from data-plane behavior, reproduce the issue with the smallest representative workload, and compare current telemetry with a known-good baseline. Choose the highest-leverage optimization and explain what to measure. Prefer an idempotent change, test it outside production, deploy progressively, and keep a rollback path. Validate the result with service metrics plus a business-level data-quality check; a technically successful run that publishes incomplete or duplicated data is still a failure.

**Strong interview signal:** state assumptions; name the metric that would confirm the diagnosis; discuss security, cost and failure recovery; and explain why the rejected alternative is weaker.
